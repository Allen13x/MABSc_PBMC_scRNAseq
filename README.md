# Single-Cell RNA Sequencing of PMBC from Cystic Fibrosis patients

This repository contains the code used for analysis: 

[_Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Shows that Circulating Monocytes Enriched in IFN Signaling Are Associated with Nontuberculous Mycobacteria Pulmonary Disease in Cystic Fibrosis_](https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.202312-2279le)


## R scripts structure:

1: Data preparation and integration starting from STAR counts matrix.

2: Clusterization and differentially gene expression analysis

3: Signature extrapolation for selected cell population

4: Bootstrapping process for DEGs

5: Deconvolution of an external bulk dataset using EWCE

6: GSEA analysis on the external bulk dataset using EWCE
